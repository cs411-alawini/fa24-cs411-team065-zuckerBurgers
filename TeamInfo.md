## Project Summary

EventCupid is an application designed to simplify the event planning process by efficiently connecting event organizers with ideal venues and vendors. Many event organizers face challenges in finding ideal venues and vendors on time, complicating the planning process and causing events to be procrastinated. Based on our research, there are few corresponding applications that address these challenges efficiently. EventCupid therefore aims to fill this gap by providing an easy-to-use platform that quickly matches event organizers with the right venues and vendors tailored to their specific needs.

EventCupid offers a dual approach: For event organizers, the platform provides advanced filtering options, allowing them to search for vendors and venues based on criteria such as price, location, capacity, and event theme. They can either directly contact their preferred choices or list their events to receive applications from interested vendors and venues. On the vendor and venue side, they can showcase their services and wait for event organizers to reach out. Alternatively, they can actively browse through listed events and apply to these.
